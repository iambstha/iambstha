- 👋 Hi, I’m @iambstha from Kathmandu, Nepal.
- 👀 I’m interested in building beautifully designed websites in JavaScript expecially using ReactJS Framework. I also love Vue.JS. I am also fond of Python and it's simplicity.
- ✨ Currently, I am learning two things: PostgreSQL for database and Selenium for web automation. Added one more on my WORKOUT list: Django. 
- 🌱 I am looking forward to learn some concepts on HTTP GET/POST Request, fetching API, callbacks, promises, mudular functions, forms in django, integration of other database in django & alot. OMG!!!
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on a design project or any non-profit project.
