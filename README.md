- 👋 Hi, I’m @iambstha from Nepal
- 👀 I’m interested in building beautifully designed projects in JavaScript expecially using ReactJS Framework. I also love Vue.JS. I am also kind of fond of Python and it's simplicity.
- ✨ Currently, I am working on a project 'TodoAppInJS'. I have created the 'issue' that I need help with. I would love to hear your feedback.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, ReactJS, a little bit of PHP too. I am looking forward to learn some concepts on HTTP GET/POST Request, fetching API, callbacks, promises, mudular functions & alot. OMG!!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a design project.
